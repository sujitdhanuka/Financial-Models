## Introduction
This repository aims to provide financial analysts, data scientists, and researchers with robust and scalable financial models. Each model includes detailed documentation, code, and example datasets to facilitate learning and implementation.

## Models

### Bankruptcy Prediction
- **Description**: Predict the likelihood of bankruptcy for companies using machine learning models.
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Datasets**: Polish Bankruptcy Data, Altman's Z-Score Data

### Credit Default Prediction
- **Description**: Assess the risk of credit default by analyzing historical credit data.
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks
- **Datasets**: Lending Club Data, Credit Card Default Data

### Merton Models
- **Description**: Apply Merton's structural model to estimate the default probability of firms.
- **Algorithms**: Merton's Model, KMV Model
- **Datasets**: Company Financial Statements, Market Data

### Value at Risk (VaR)
- **Description**: Calculate the potential loss in value of a portfolio using VaR methodologies.
- **Algorithms**: Historical Simulation, Monte Carlo Simulation, Parametric VaR
- **Datasets**: Stock Price Data, Portfolio Data

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Description**: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anomaly detection techniques.
- **Algorithms**: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, Ensemble Methods
- **Datasets**: Credit Card Transactions Data
